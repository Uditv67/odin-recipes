            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Frosting:
            <ul>
                <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
                <li>1/4 cup confectioners' sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons coffee flavoured liqueur</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Garnish:
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
                <li>1 ounce semisweet chocolate</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour three 9-inch pans.</li>
        <li>To make the cake: Beat cake mix, water, egg whites, and oil in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until well combined, about 2 minutes. Divide 2/3 of the batter between 2 prepared pans. Stir instant coffee into remaining batter; pour into the remaining prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of cakes comes out clean, 23 to 28 minutes. Cool cakes in the pans for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        <li>To make the syrup: Combine brewed coffee and coffee liqueur in a measuring cup; set aside.</li>
        <li>To make the filling: Beat mascarpone, confectioners' sugar, and coffee liqueur in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on low speed until smooth. Cover with plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator to keep cool.</li>
        <li>To make the frosting: Beat cream, confectioners' sugar, and coffee liqueur in a medium bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until stiff. Fold 1/2 cup frosting into chilled filling until combined. Store frosting and filling, covered, in the refrigerator to keep cool.</li>
        <li>To assemble the cake: Place 1 plain cake layer on a serving plate. Using a thin skewer, poke holes in cake, about 1 inch apart. Pour 1/3 of the coffee syrup over cake, then cover with 1/2 of the filling. Top with coffee-flavored cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour another 1/3 of the coffee syrup over cake and cover with remaining filling. Top with remaining cake layer; poke holes in cake. Pour remaining coffee syrup on top. Spread sides and top of cake with frosting.</li>
        <li>To garnish the cake: Place cocoa powder in a sieve and lightly dust top of cake. Run a vegetable peeler down the edge of chocolate square to form curls. Scatter chocolate curls over cake.</li>
        <li>Chill cake in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
